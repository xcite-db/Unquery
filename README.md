# Unquery Lite

## About

The query language `~Q` (pronounced "unquery) is a fast, powerful and flexible language for querying structured documents. It was originally developed as the query language for [XCiteDB](http://www.xcitedb.com), a fast and reliable noSQL database for structured documents, supporting XML, JSON, and other features such as temporal versioning and branches. 

This repository contains *unquery-lite*, a stand-alone tool for querying, transforming and analyzing JSON files using `~Q`. It reads either a single or multiple JSON files and a ~Q query, and produce a single JSON output based on the query.
